IndustrialMonitorA WPF-based desktop application designed for real-time monitoring and control of industrial process data via Siemens S7-1500 PLCs. The project is structured using the MVVM pattern and specifically optimized for testing with PLCSIM Advanced.FeaturesLive Data Tracking: Monitor critical parameters including tank levels, temperature, pressure, and motor speed.PLC Integration: Uses S7.Net for direct communication with Siemens hardware.Simulation Fallback: Automatically switches to simulation mode if the PLC is unavailable, ensuring the UI remains functional for testing.Command & Control: Built-in support for toggling system states and updating PLC registers directly from the interface.Tech Stack.NET 10.0 (WPF)S7.Net 0.20.0 for S7 protocol communicationMVVM Architecture for clean separation of concernsGetting StartedPrerequisitesVisual Studio 2022 or latest .NET SDK.Siemens TIA Portal.PLCSIM Advanced (recommended for local testing).SetupClone the repository and restore dependencies:Bashdotnet restore
Configure your PLC IP address in Services/PlcService.cs. The default is set to 192.168.0.1.Build and run the application.Click "Connect PLC" in the footer to initialize communication.PLC Configuration (DB1)To interface with the application, create a Global Data Block (DB1) in TIA Portal with the following structure:NameData TypeOffsetDescriptionTankLevelReal0.0Tank level (%)TemperatureReal4.0Temperature (°C)PressureReal8.0Pressure (bar)MotorSpeedDInt12.0Motor speed (rpm)SystemRunningBool16.0System statusImportant: Ensure "Optimized block access" is disabled for the Data Block and "Permit access with PUT/GET" is enabled in the CPU security settings.Project StructureCore: Base classes for MVVM (ObservableObject, RelayCommand).Models: Data contracts for process variables.Services: Logic for PLC connectivity and data polling.ViewModels: UI logic and state management.Views: XAML definitions for the user interface.LicenseCreated for industrial automation testing and educational purposes.
